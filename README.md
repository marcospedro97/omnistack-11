#########                   OMNISTACK 11                           #############

My project made for OMNISTACK 11 a free course of 1 week duration with
made to help learning Node.js and React.js and it really helped me to make things
clear in my mind with those technologies, so it's a nice repo to take a look

# File Structure

- Backend

	This part is a API rest that will handle the rules of the service, database,
	authentication (wich is as simple as possible) and serve all data with json
	to run, make sure you have node.js in your machine and run the following

	*yarn install*

	*yarn start*	

- Frontend
	This part is the server wich will be send as website to the final user, it
	doesn't need anything but a browser and node.js to be checked to run use

	*yarn install*

	*yarn start*

- Mobile
	This part to be runned needs a mobile device and does the same as the frontend
	to run use make sure you have a android emulator (it'll also work with iOS)
	running in your machine and then run or your phone with expo installed
	
	*yarn install*

	*yarn start*

	the last one will open a browser window where you can chose either scan a
	qrcode in your phone or use a phone emulator running in your machine, case
	you want use in your phone make sure it's in the same network as your computer
